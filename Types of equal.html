    <h1 style="text-align:center">The differences between =, ==, and .equals</h1>
    <p style="font-size:18px">The = is simply and assignment operator, meaning it
                              assigns the values on the right side to the left
                              side.  A simple example is a = 5, that assigns
                              the value 5 to variable a.  A little more complex
                              example would be c = 7 + 3 that assigns the
                              value of 10(7+3) to c.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px">The == is a relational operator, meaning it compares
                              two values and returns true of false.  2 simple
                              examples would be 8 == 8 which would return true
                              and 9 == 8 which would return false.  A couple of
                              a little more complex examples 8 == 4 + 4 would
                              return true and 4 + 5 == 8 would be false.  You
                              can do arithmetic on either or both sides of this
                              operator and it will return true if the sides are
                              equal and false if they are not.  Use caution when
                              using == on Strings as it might not work the way
                              you expect (keep reading).

    <p style ="font-size:18px"> Which brings us to .equals which is basically
                                a way to compare Strings in java.  If you try
                                to use == to compare to string variables it will
                                always return false unless they are the same, ie
                                occupy the same location in memory.  If you use
                                .equals it will compare the contents of the String
                                and return true if they match.

    <p style="font-size:18px">  In conclusion, you would use = to assign a value
                                any variable (Int, String, Double, etc.).  You
                                would use == to compare numbers(Int, Double) or
                                to see if two variables are the same object.  You
                                would use .equals to see if two strings had the
                                same contents.
