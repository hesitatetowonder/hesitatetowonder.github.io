    <h1 style="text-align:center">The difference between "switch" and "if/else"
                                  in Java</h1>
    <p style="font-size:18px">The "switch" command is best used when you have
                              one variable that is to be evaluated against multiple
                              different values. The "switch" command evaluates
                              "case" statements and will begin execution when
                              it encounters one that evaluates "true", if the
                              "case" statement does not contain "break" at the
                              end it will also execute every "case" statement
                              that comes after the one that evaluated as "true".
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px">
                               And "if/else" statement is best used when you
                               have several different conditions and/or variables
                               you need to compare for different outcomes.  The
                               "if/else" statement will execute the code block
                               of the first true "if", or "else if" it comes to
                               and exit the code block.  "Else" is only used as
                               the final code block and will be executed if no
                               "if" or "else if" statement evaluates as true.
    </p>
    <p style ="font-size:18px">

                                In conclusion, you should use a "switch" statement
                                if you are comparing one variable against multiple
                                conditions and only want code executed if one of
                                the statements evaluates as true, use an "if/else"
                                statement if you need different results for different
                                variable conditions.  If you use the "switch" command
                                make sure you put a break after each case statement
                                to avoid having all the case statements after the true
                                one execute.
