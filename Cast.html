    <h1 style="text-align:center">Casting a double to an int (and vice versa) in
                                  Java</h1>
    <p style="font-size:18px">First lets define our terms.
                              <strong>Casting</strong> = temporarily changing
                              the type of value (for compatibility).
                              <strong>double</strong>=floating point decimal.
                              The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit
                              IEEE 754 floating point. (There is also a float in
                              Java, which is a 32-bit precision IEEE 754 floating
                              point, but must be implicitly called ie 3.6 is a
                              double, 3.6f is a float.)
                              <strong>int</strong>=integer(Variables of type int
                              store the actual binary value for the integer you
                              want to represent).

    <p style="font-size:18px">So, now that we know what we are talking about:
                              when you "cast a double to an int" you are
                              changing a decimal (temporarily) into and integer.
                              When you "cast an int to a double" you reverse this
                              process.
                              Keep in mind that when any portion of the operation
                              is a double then all values will be automatically
                              cast to a double by java, but, if you have a double
                              that you cast to an (int) it will be set to int.0 for
                              the operation if their is a double involved.

    <p style="font-size:18px">When might you want to cast a double to an int?
                              Anytime you want a whole number.  If you need
                              a rough estimate of square footage you might
                              prefer to get 36 square feet as opposed to 36.32
                              square feet.
