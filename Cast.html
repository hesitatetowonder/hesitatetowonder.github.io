    <h1 style="text-align:center">Casting a double to an int(and vice versa) in
                                  Java</h1>
    <p style="font-size:18px">First lets define our terms.
                              <strong>Casting</strong> = temporarily changing
                              the type of value(for compatibility).
                              <strong>double</strong>=floating point decimal
                              (The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit
                              IEEE 754 floating point).
                              <strong>int</strong>=integer(Variables of type int
                              store the actual binary value for the integer you
                              want to represent).
                              So, when you "cast a double to an int" you are
                              changing a decimal(temporarily) into and integer.
                              When you "cast an int to a double" you reverse this
                              process.
                              Keep in mind that when any portion of the operation
                              is a double then all values will be automatically
                              cast to a double by java, but, if you have a double
                              that you cast to an (int) it will be set to int.0 for
                              the operation if their is a double involved.

    <p style="font-size:18px">When might you want to use this?
                              Anytime you want a whole number.  If you were having
                              a birthday party for your 9 year old niece and
                              wanted to know how many pieces of candy(there are
                              13) you should give to each of the guests(there are
                              4) you would only need to know the whole number (3)
                              and not the decimal(3.25).
